Main:
Avoid using spaces immediately after opening tags.
<clr:r,g,b>
  Sets the color of the caption using an RGB color; 0 is no color, 255 is full color.
  For example, <clr:255,100,100> would be red.
  <clr> with no arguments will restore the previous color for all text following, but only if you have set the color at least twice
<B>
  Toggles bold text for the next phrase.
<I>
  Toggles italicised text for the next phrase.
<U>
  Toggles underlined text for the next phrase. Appears to be disabled in the TF2 build.
<cr>
  Go to new line for next phrase.
Other:
<sfx>
  Marks a line as a sound effect that will only be displayed with full closed captioning.
  If the user has cc_subtitles 1, it will not display these lines.
<delay:#>
  Sets a pre-display delay. The sfx tag overrides this. This tag should come before all others. Can take a decimal value.

Unknown:
<sameline>
  Don't go to new line for next phrase.
<linger:#> / <persist:#> / <len:#>
  Indicates how much longer than usual the caption should appear on the screen.
<position:where>
  I don't know how this one works, but from the sdk comments:
  Draw caption at special location ??? needed.
<norepeat:#>
  Sets how long until the caption can appear again. Useful for frequent sounds.
